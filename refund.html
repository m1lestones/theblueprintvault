        <h2>6. Bundle Refunds</h2>

        <h2>7. Chargeback Policy</h2>
        <p>If you file a chargeback with your credit card company instead of contacting us first, we will deny your refund request and may suspend your access to future purchases. We encourage you to reach out to us first to resolve any issues.</p>
